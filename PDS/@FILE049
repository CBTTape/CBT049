//***FILE 049 is an old program from Bruce Leland called STATS.     *   FILE 049
//*           This program reports statistics on the internal       *   FILE 049
//*           structure of partitioned datasets and other dataset   *   FILE 049
//*           types.  Its original place was from File 213 of the   *   FILE 049
//*           old CBT Tapes, before Arnie made his wholesale        *   FILE 049
//*           deletions.  (This program came from CBT Tape Version  *   FILE 049
//*           249.)                                                 *   FILE 049

//*           This program is still extremely relevant to us,       *   FILE 049

//*       Description:  This program formats information on         *   FILE 049
//*           several types of disk data sets.  It reads            *   FILE 049
//*           through the entire data set and outputs disk          *   FILE 049
//*           track usage, record sizes, counts and other           *   FILE 049
//*           statistics.                                           *   FILE 049

//*           In addition, several data set validity checks are     *   FILE 049
//*           performed during input processing to insure that      *   FILE 049
//*           the data set will be usable by the system for         *   FILE 049
//*           non-EXCP processing.                                  *   FILE 049

//*           If any errors are encountered, the Return Code is     *   FILE 049
//*           set to 4095 (or the program abends); otherwise,       *   FILE 049
//*           the Return Code is set to the minimum of 4094 and     *   FILE 049
//*           the number of tracks which should compress out        *   FILE 049

//*           c.  The program then reads through the data set       *   FILE 049
//*               and outputs disk track usage, record sizes,       *   FILE 049
//*               counts and other statistics.                      *   FILE 049

//*                  through the entire data set (there may be      *   FILE 049
//*                  several files of data) and reports on each     *   FILE 049
//*                  file.  also, the program inputs the ISAM       *   FILE 049
//*                  label (Format Two DSCB) record and             *   FILE 049
//*                  provides a data set profile which includes     *   FILE 049
//*                  data set reorganization data and data set      *   FILE 049
//*                  characteristics.                               *   FILE 049
//*               3. For Partitioned Data Sets, if the data set     *   FILE 049
//*                  name and a member name is allocated to the     *   FILE 049
//*                  input data set, the member is processed        *   FILE 049
//*                  like a sequential data set.                    *   FILE 049
//*               4. For other Partitioned Data Sets, the           *   FILE 049
//*                  program compares directory TTR's against       *   FILE 049
//*                  actual disk addresses to provide a report      *   FILE 049
//*                  by gas member:                                 *   FILE 049
//*                  a.  For load libraries, the linkage-edit       *   FILE 049
//*                      date and the names of the first few        *   FILE 049
//*                      CSECTs are provided.                       *   FILE 049

//*                      characters of each gas member is           *   FILE 049
//*                      output.                                    *   FILE 049
//*                  Statistics are maintained on the size of       *   FILE 049
//*                  gas and real members and the number of         *   FILE 049
//*                  alias members.  STATS checks for aliases       *   FILE 049
//*                  which have no real entries and apparent        *   FILE 049
//*                  aliases (two real members with the same        *   FILE 049
